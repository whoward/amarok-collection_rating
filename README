If you're like me you want your whole Amarok music collection rated according
to your own personal tastes.  Why? so you can play the songs you like more 
often with those nice dynamic playlists.

Wouldn't it be nice to have a plugin suited to doing just that?  Here it is!

Installation Instructions:

To generate from source code you need Rake installed and need to be running
on Linux or OSX.

   rake make:tarball
   
Then just install the generated plugin file inside Amarok:
 
  Tools -> Script Manager -> Install Script -> (choose generated file)
